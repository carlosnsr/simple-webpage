(e.g. Amazon, Google, Microcenter)

## What is a README?

A README is a file that introduces the project to the viewer.
By convention, it is called README as a hint for the viewer to read it!

Every project should begin with a README file.
It should contain a description of the project,
and steps on how to download and install your project.
When a viewer goes to your project on GitHub,
the README will automatically be displayed.

You know that HTML is a text markup language.
This README is written using another text markup language, called
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#what).
Markdown is useful for creating text files that are easy to read,
and that can be converted into HTML or PDF.
